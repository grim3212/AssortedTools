/**
 * Puts this mod's test functions into {@code BuiltInRegistries.TEST_FUNCTION}.
 * <p>
 * Fabric has no annotation that discovers a class the way FML's {@code @EventBusSubscriber} does,
 * and nothing in {@code main} may reference the gametest source set - that is what would drag the
 * tests into the shipped jar. So the gametest source set carries its own {@code fabric.mod.json}
 * and loads as a second, development-only mod that depends on this one. It is not built into any
 * release artifact.
 * <p>
 * Fabric's own {@code @GameTest} annotation is not used: it defines the test <em>instance</em> as
 * well as the function, which would duplicate the {@code test_instance} jsons that NeoForge and
 * Fabric already share.
